I also do lots of applied work in oceanography and hydrodynamics.\nI was previously a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds where I worked on uncertainty quantification in paleo-climate glaciology.\nI have also worked in ecological restoration, materials engineering, prognostics and health management, and have consulted for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy."
