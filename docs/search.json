    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nOceanography has long sought to understand the spatial and temporal structure of many different oceanographic processes: turbulent decay, tides, surface waves, internal waves, internal tides, and the list goes on. Most commonly, oceanographers use spectral analysis as the main tool to infer any parameters of interest, relying on regularly sampled observations of the particular process. This works well, for example, for mooring data that records temporal measurements at a single location in space, or for satellite data that records spatial measurements at single locations in time. Increasingly, we are building large data-sets that combine many different observation platforms with the aim to resolve the 3D (and 4D) spatio-temporal characteristics. Gaussian processes provide a principled method to merge all these data inside of a coherent inferential framework and are increasingly being recognised in oceanography. In this presentation, I will cover varied applications of Gaussian processes in oceanography, from relatively simple examples of temporal forecasting of surface tides, to some nascent attempts of inferring flow properties from multiple observation platforms. Finally, I’ll highlight some methodological gaps that we are looking to resolve.\n\n\nLinks\ncoming…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nBayes linear statistics eschews probabilistic assumptions and instead poses the statistical inference problem by viewing expectation, rather than probability, as the fundamental unit of belief. Bayes linear techniques were most popular throughout the 80s and 90s when computational power was small(er) and MCMC methods were nascent. In the present day, Bayes linear inference has been largely supplanted by probabilistic techniques and is commonly reduced to ‘’the Bayes linear equations’’’, viewed as the Gaussian update when we don’t want to be explicit about assuming Gaussianity. This is unfortunate as the Bayes linear paradigm provides a coherent and principled framework by which we can update beliefs without the burden of forming fully probabilistic belief specifications. Even beyond philosophy, a Bayes linear analysis can be much faster than a similar probabilistic analysis and implies a simpler specification of prior quantities. In this presentation I’ll examine some recent developments that attempt to rescue Bayes linear statistics from history’s maw and will argue for the role of Bayes linear statistics in the modern statistician’s toolbox. Examples will be provided from coexchangeability modelling in climate science, the analysis of UK COVID19 deaths, and emulating an afforestation uptake model.\n\n\nLinks\n[pdf]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMost non-parametric spectral estimation methodologies are based on transformations of the periodogram, a biased and statistically inconsistent estimator to the true spectral density. To enforce consistency, we average partitions of the periodogram; although, doing so increases the bias. Consequently, we become increasingly certain in an estimate that is increasingly wrong. This is particularly seen in Welch’s estimator, the most widespread estimator for non-parametric spectral density estimation in the engineering and physical sciences. In this seminar we show, by extending some recent results, how to debias Welch’s estimate whilst retaining optimal convergence guarantees. This results in a non-parametric estimator to the spectral density that is optimally convergent in RMSE, a property, until now, absent in the literature. We show results for efficient computation and demonstrate application across a range of oceanographic and hydrodynamic datasets.\n\n\nLinks\n[pdf]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nNonlinear internal waves (often referred to as solitons) produce transient bursts of high velocity as they propagate on the continental shelf, leading to massive structural loads that disrupt offshore operations. These waves are difficult to both characterise and predict with ocean circulation numerical models or existing monitoring techniques. Observing the spatial and temporal properties of internal waves is difficult and typically only sparse observations are available. We have developed methodology to efficiently model and predict internal wave properties and behaviour using modern statistical and machine learning methods. The methodologies are Bayesian, meaning that we can quantify uncertainty over the parameter estimates and predictions in a mathematically coherent way, leading to probabilistic inference and forecasting. Robust statistical modelling of internal wave behaviour will lead to better numerical modelling (due to more realistic boundary conditions), better site characterisation (to inform operations), and better forecasting (for existing operations). This presentation will focus on some of the methodologies being developed within the Ocean’s Graduate School at the University of Western Australia to better characterise and predict internal wave behaviour, with focus on the Australian North-West Shelf.\n\n\nLinks\n[pdf] [keynote] [conference listing]\nSee keynote presentation for animations."

We develop efficient quantification of these uncertainties that combines relevant data from multiple models and observations. Starting from the coexchangeability model, we develop a coexchangeable process model to capture multiple correlated spatio-temporal fields of variables. We demonstrate that further exchangeability judgments over the parameters within this representation lead to a Bayes linear analogy of a hierarchical model. We use the framework to provide a joint reconstruction of sea-surface temperature and sea-ice concentration boundary conditions at the last glacial maximum (23–19 kya) and use it to force an ensemble of ice-sheet simulations using the FAMOUS-Ice coupled atmosphere and ice-sheet model.

    "text": "Gaussian Processes\nA Gaussian process (GP) is an infinite dimensional stochastic process where any finite subsample of the process follows a multivariate normal distribution (see here for a good visual introduction). Define by \\(y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) the random variable over which we define the GP, and by \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) the locations over which the \\(y\\) are observed. We write \\[y \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(m(x), k(x, x'))\\] where \\(m: \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(k: \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) are the mean and covariance functions, respectively.\nThis is the mathematical definition of the continuous stochastic process, but in the real world world we may only make discrete observations. Define the collection of observations as \\(\\textbf{y} = (y_1, \\dots, y_n)\\) with corresponding locations \\((x_1, \\dots, x_n)\\). As per the definition of a GP, the \\(\\textbf{y}\\) thus follow a multivariate normal distribution, so that \\[\\mathbf{y} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{\\mu}, \\Sigma),\\] where \\[ \\mathbf{\\mu} = \\begin{bmatrix} m(x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ m(x_n) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} k(x_1, x_1) & \\cdots & k(x_1, x_n) \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ k(x_n, x_1) & \\cdots & k(x_n, x_n) \\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\n\nObserving Derivatives\nConsider now we observe the derivatives \\(\\frac{d}{dx} y \\equiv \\partial_x y\\). Say we wish to remain specifying our beliefs of \\(y\\) via \\(m(\\cdot)\\) and \\(k(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\), how do we incorporate this information?\nThe functions \\(m(\\cdot)\\) and \\(k(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\) have been defined in terms of \\(x\\), and so adjusting them in terms of \\(y\\) (or, rather, it’s derivative) may not seem immediately intuitive. Instead consider that \\(m(x_i) = \\mathbb{E}[y_i]\\) and \\(k(x_i, x_j) = \\mathrm{cov}[y_i, y_j]\\); this is seen by the roles that \\(m(\\cdot)\\) and \\(k(\\cdot, \\cdot)\\) take in the equations above.\nCalculating the first two moments of \\(\\partial_x y\\) we get \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\partial_x y] = \\partial_x \\mathbb{E}[y] = \\partial_x m(x)\\) and \\(\\mathrm{cov}[\\partial_x y, \\partial_{x'} y'] = \\partial_{x x'} \\mathrm{cov}[ y, y'] = \\partial_{x x'} k(x, x')\\). Here I have made use of the property of linearity of derivatives, expectations, and covariance operators.\nNow define \\(\\partial_\\textbf{x} \\textbf{y} = (\\partial_{x_1} y_1, \\dots, \\partial_{x_m} y_m)\\) with corresponding locations \\((x_1, \\dots, x_m)\\). Similar to above we may describe \\(\\partial_\\textbf{x} \\textbf{y}\\) as being sampled from the normal distribution \\[\\partial_\\textbf{x} \\textbf{y} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\partial_\\textbf{x} \\mu, \\partial_{\\textbf{xx}'} \\Sigma)\\] where \\[ \\partial_\\textbf{x} \\mu = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial_{x_1} m(x_1) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\partial_{x_m} m(x_m) \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\partial_{\\textbf{xx}'} \\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial_{x_1 x_1} k(x_1, x_1) & \\cdots & \\partial_{x_1 x_m} k(x_1, x_m) \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\partial_{x_m x_1} k(x_m, x_1) & \\cdots & \\partial_{x_m x_m} k(x_m, x_m) \\end{bmatrix}\\].\n\n\nUpdating with mixed observations\nWe may also form the joint distribution between the process and its derivatives. For example, this may be to combine the observations from different measurement platforms, or to form conditional distributions. The only additional term we require is the off-diagonal term corresponding to the \\(\\mathrm{cov}[y, \\partial_{x'} y'] = \\partial_{x'} \\mathrm{cov}[y, y'] = \\partial_{x'} k(x, x')\\). The joint normal distribution is \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\textbf{y} \\\\ \\partial_\\textbf{x} \\textbf{y} \\end{bmatrix} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} \\mu \\\\ \\partial_\\textbf{x} \\mu \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} \\Sigma & \\partial_{\\textbf{x}'} \\Sigma \\\\ \\partial_{\\textbf{x}} \\Sigma & \\partial_{\\textbf{xx}'} \\Sigma \\end{bmatrix} \\right),\\] \\[\\text{where} \\quad \\partial_{\\textbf{x}'} \\Sigma = (\\partial_{\\textbf{x}} \\Sigma)^\\intercal = \\begin{bmatrix} \\partial_{x_1} k(x_1, x_1) & \\cdots & \\partial_{x_m} k(x_1, x_m) \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \\partial_{x_1} k(x_n, x_1) & \\cdots & \\partial_{x_m} k(x_n, x_m) \\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\n\nExample: The Helmholtz Kernel\nThe primary motivation for writing this article was to provide a proof to equations (4)–(6) and (10)–(12) in our recent article on inferring flow properties from Lagrangian drifters. The mathematics involved with incorporating derivative information for 1D process is straightforward. Moving to more than 1 dimension, there are some handy tricks to use.\nDefine the zonal and meridional velocities, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), as the sum of rotational and divergent components \\[u = -\\partial_y \\psi + \\partial_x \\phi,\\] \\[v = \\partial_x \\psi + \\partial_y \\phi\\] where \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are the streamfunction and velocity-potential fields defined over a domain \\(\\textbf{x} = [x, y] \\in \\mathcal{X}\\). We specify the auto and cross covariance functions for \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) (\\(\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi']\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\phi']\\), and \\(\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\phi']\\)) and from this generate covariance functions for \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). To form the joint distribution of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) we require expressions for \\(\\mathrm{cov}[u, u']\\), \\(\\mathrm{cov}[v, v']\\), and \\(\\mathrm{cov}[u, v']\\). These are fairly easily obtained using basic properties of covariance. For example, \\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{cov}[u, v'] &= \\mathrm{cov}[-\\partial_y \\psi + \\partial_x \\phi, \\partial_{x'} \\psi + \\partial_{y'} \\phi] \\\\\n&= \\mathrm{cov}[-\\partial_y \\psi, \\partial_{x'} \\psi] + \\mathrm{cov}[\\partial_x \\phi, \\partial_{x'} \\psi] + \\mathrm{cov}[-\\partial_y \\psi, \\partial_{y'} \\phi] + \\mathrm{cov}[\\partial_x \\phi, \\partial_{y'} \\phi] \\\\\n&= -\\partial_{yx'}\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] + \\partial_{xx'}\\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\psi] - \\partial_{yy'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\phi] + \\partial_{xy'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\phi].\n\\end{align}\\] Expressions for \\(\\mathrm{cov}[u, u']\\) and \\(\\mathrm{cov}[v, v']\\) are similarly obtained as \\[\\begin{align}\n  \\mathrm{cov}[u, u'] &= \\partial_{yy'}\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] + \\partial_{xx'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\phi] - \\partial_{yx'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\phi] - \\partial_{xy'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\psi], \\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n  \\mathrm{cov}[v, v'] &= \\partial_{xx'}\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] + \\partial_{yy'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\phi] + \\partial_{xy'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\phi] + \\partial_{yx'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\phi, \\psi].\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe fields \\(\\psi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) are defined over two dimensions \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and it is most common to define the covariance functions as isotropic (so that covariance is a function of the Euclidean distance) and stationary (so that covariance is independent of the input location and only a function of distance). Define distance as \\(r = (\\tau_x^2 + \\tau_y^2)^{1/2}\\) where \\(\\tau_x = x - x'\\) and \\(\\tau_y = y - y'\\). Before we proceed, let’s establish the following relations: \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y} = \\frac{\\tau_y}{(\\tau_x^2 + \\tau_y^2)^{1/2}} = \\frac{\\tau_y}{r}, \\tag{1}\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y}{\\mathrm{d} y} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y}{\\mathrm{d} y'} = -1, \\tag{2}\\] \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y} \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y} \\tau_y(\\tau_x^2 + \\tau_y^2)^{-1/2} = (\\tau_x^2 + \\tau_y^2)^{-1/2} - \\tau_y^2(\\tau_x^2 + \\tau_y^2)^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{\\tau_y^2}{r^3} = \\frac{\\tau_x^2}{r^3}. \\tag{3}\\] Similar relations follow for \\(x\\) and \\(\\tau_x\\). Consider \\(\\partial_{yy'}\\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi]\\). This may be expressed as \\[\\begin{align}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d} y y'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} y'} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} r} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] \\frac{\\mathrm{d} r}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y}{\\mathrm{d} y} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} y'} \\left( \\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\cdot \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} \\right)\n\\end{align}\\] where here we have made use of the chain rule and Equations 1 and 2. Note, that the notation \\(\\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\equiv \\partial_r \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi]\\), and similarly for the second derivatives below. Now, employing the product rule, we get \\[\\begin{align}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d} y y'} \\mathrm{cov}[\\psi, \\psi] &= \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} y'} \\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} + \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} y'} \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} \\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\\\\n&= \\left(- \\mathrm{cov}''[\\psi, \\psi] \\cdot \\frac{\\tau_y}{r}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} + \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y} \\frac{\\tau_y}{r} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\tau_y}{\\mathrm{d} y'} \\right) \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\\\\n&= - \\left( \\frac{\\tau_y^2}{r^2} \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}''[\\psi, \\psi] + \\frac{\\tau_x^2}{r^3} \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}'[\\psi, \\psi] \\right)\\end{align}\\] where this final step uses the relation in Equation 3. This leads to Equation (10) in our paper, and Equations (11) and (12) follow similarly.\n\nContact\nPlease email me if you either have questions, edits, contributions, suggestions for improvements, or just to say thanks.
