## About

I am a Research Fellow for the TIDE ARC ITRH in the School of Physics, Mathematics and Computing at The University of Western Australia. 

I am a research statistician with interest in both methodological and applied research. From a methodological standpoint, I have interest in spectral analysis, emulation of engineering computer models, and many aspects of uncertainty quantification. I also do lots of applied work in oceanography and hydrodynamics.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow in the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds where I worked on uncertainty quantification in paleo-climate glaciology.

I have also worked in ecological restoration, materials engineering, prognostics and health management, and have consulted for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.

## Contact

Please contact me via email, I very seldom check any social media channels, including LinkedIn. I am accepting research students in statistics and oceanography, don't be shy in reaching out. I also have some capacity for statistical/data-science consulting or other applied research should my expertise be of interest.
