### Abstract

This was a workshop presentation given to the School of Earth and Environment about the fundamentals of Kriging. What is it? How does it work? What do we need to think about when Kriging? There is lots of information about this elsewhere, this was an attempt to help out some of the applied scientists with which I was working.
