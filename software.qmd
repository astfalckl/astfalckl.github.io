### [gptide](https://github.com/TIDE-ITRH/gptide)

<div style="height:105px;"> A lightweight module for Gaussian process regression toolkit in python. There are many other Gaussian Process packages -- this package is yet another one. The selling point of this package is that the object is fairly straightforward and the kernel building is all done with functions, not abstract classes. </div>
